class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>FreeDV GUI (or just FreeDV) is a GUI program for Linux, Windows, and
macOS for running FreeDV on a desktop PC or laptop.</p>
<p>This is a live document. Notes on new FreeDV features are being added
as they are developed.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="getting-started"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Getting Started</h1>
<p>This section contains instructions to help you get started.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="easy-setup"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Easy Setup</h2>
<p>Upon starting FreeDV for the first time, the Easy Setup dialog will
appear. This is a streamlined setup process for FreeDV optimized for
hardware commonly used by amateur radio operators and is divided into
three sections:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sound card configuration,</li>
<li>CAT/PTT control, and</li>
<li>Reporting.</li>
</ol>
<p>These sections are shown below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="contrib/easy_setup.png" alt="Easy Setup dialog" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Easy Setup dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that you can always return to this dialog by going to <em>Tools
- Easy Setup</em>.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.1.1" id="sound-card-configuration"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Sound Card Configuration</h3>
<p>To configure your sound card(s) using Easy Setup, simply select the
sound device associated with your radio and the microphone and speaker
devices you wish to use to hear decoded audio as well as to transmit
audio. If you’re setting up a receive-only station, you can choose
“None” for the transmit audio device.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are using a Flex 6000 series radio on the
Windows platform, FreeDV will automatically select the DAX TX sound
device. It is necessary only to select the correct “slice” for the radio
sound device and the two devices to use for analog receive and transmit
(e.g. your computer’s built in microphone and speaker devices).</p>
<p>Note that some configurations (for example, SDR setups involving
multiple radio sound devices) may not be able to be configured with Easy
Setup. For those, you can choose the “Advanced” button and proceed to
“Advanced Setup” below.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.1.2" id="catptt-control"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> CAT/PTT control</h3>
<p>Easy Setup supports three methods of radio control:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No radio control (e.g. using a VOX audio device such as
SignaLink),</li>
<li>Hamlib CAT control, and</li>
<li>Serial port PTT control.</li>
</ol>
<p>Simply select the option that matches your radio setup and the
required fields will appear. For Hamlib, these are typically the type of
radio you’re using as well as the serial port it’s connected to (or
TCP/IP hostname:port). Serial port PTT control requires the serial port
your radio is using as well as whether your radio’s PTT is triggered via
the RTS or DTR pin (and the required polarity for either).</p>
<p>If required, the “Advanced” button in this section will allow you to
configure PTT input (e.g. for a footswitch) and additional VOX related
options. The “Test” button will emit a constant carrier on the selected
radio sound device as well as enable PTT to allow you to adjust your
radio sound levels (see “Sound Card Levels” below).</p>
<h3 data-number="2.1.3" id="reporting"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Reporting</h3>
<p>While not required, it is recommended to enable reporting so that
others can see who is currently receiving them. This also allows the
FreeDV application to control the radio’s frequency and mode. Both sides
of a contact must have this enabled in order for contacts to be
reported. To configure reporting, simply enable the feature here and
enter your callsign and current grid square/locator.</p>
<p>For more information about the reporting feature, see the “FreeDV
Reporting” section below.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="advanced-setup"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Advanced Setup</h2>
<h3 data-number="2.2.1" id="sound-card-configuration-1"><span

<h4 data-number="2.2.1.1" id="receive-only-one-sound-card"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.1.1</span> Receive Only (One Sound
Card)</h4>
<p>For this setup, you just need the basic sound hardware in your
computer, for example a microphone/speaker on your computer.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the <em>Tools - Audio Config</em> Dialog</li>
<li>At the bottom select <em>Receive</em> Tab</li>
<li>In <em>Input To Computer From Radio</em> select your default sound
input device (usually at the top)</li>
<li>In the <em>Output From Computer To Speaker/Headphones</em> window
select your default sound output device (usually at the top)</li>
<li>At the bottom select <em>Transmit</em> Tab</li>
<li>In <em>Input From Microphone To Computer</em> window select
<em>none</em></li>
<li>In <em>Output From Computer To Radio</em> window select
<em>none</em></li>
<li>Press OK to close the dialog</li>
</ol>
<p>When you press Start FreeDV will start decoding any incoming signals
on the microphone input, playing the decoded audio out of your speaker.
If no valid FreeDV signals are received, no audio will be played.</p>
<p>If you connect the microphone input on your computer to your radio
receiver, you can decode off air signals. If you have a rig interface,
try configuring that as the <em>From Radio To Computer</em> device, with
your computer’s sound card as the <em>From Computer To
Speaker/Headphone</em> device.</p>
<p>If you don’t have anyone to transmit FreeDV signals to you, try the
test wave files in the next section.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.2.1.2" id="transmitreceive-two-sound-cards"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.1.2</span> Transmit/Receive (Two Sound
Cards)</h4>
<p>For TX/RX operation you need to configure two sound cards, by setting
up Tools - Audio Config <em>Transmit</em> and <em>Receive</em> Tabs.</p>
<p>When receiving, FreeDV off-air signals <strong>from</strong> your
radio are decoded by your computer and sent <strong>to</strong> your
speaker/headphones, where you can listen to them.</p>
<p>When transmitting, FreeDV takes your voice <strong>from</strong> the
microphone, and encodes it to a FreeDV signal in you computer which is
sent <strong>to</strong> your radio for transmission over the air.</p>

<h4 data-number="2.2.1.3" id="changing-audio-devices"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.1.3</span> Changing Audio Devices</h4>
<p>If you change audio devices (e.g. add or remove sound cards, USB
hardware), it’s a good idea to check the Tools/Audio Config dialog
before pressing <strong>Start</strong>, to verify the audio devices are
as expected. This is particularly important if any audio devices
e.g. Headsets, USB Sound Cards, or Virtual Cables have been disconnected
since the last time FreeDV was used.</p>
<p>Hitting <strong>Refresh</strong> in the lower left hand corner of the
Tools/Audio Config will normally update the audio devices list. Keeping
a screen shot of a known working configuration will be useful for new
users. Unexpected audio configuration changes may also occur following a
Windows updates.</p>
<p>Another solution is to re-start FreeDV and check Tools/Audio Config
again after changing any audio hardware.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.2" id="catptt-configuration"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> CAT/PTT Configuration</h3>
<p>The Tools-&gt;CAT and PTT Config dialog supports three different ways
to control PTT on your radio:</p>
<ul>
<li>VOX: sends a tone to the left channel of the Transmit/To Radio sound
card</li>
<li>Hamlib: support for many different radios via the Hamlib library and
a serial port (or via TCP/IP for some devices, e.g. SDRs or
FLrig/rigctld).</li>
<li>Serial Port: direct access to the serial port pins</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also optionally configure a second serial port for PTT input.
This can be useful for interfacing devices like foot switches to FreeDV.
If configured, FreeDV will switch into transmit mode (including sending
the needed Hamlib or serial commands to initiate PTT) when it detects
the configured signal.</p>
<p>Once you have configured PTT, try the <strong>Test</strong>
button.</p>
<p>Serial PTT support is complex. We get many reports that FreeDV PTT
doesn’t work on a particular radio, but may work fine with other
programs such as Fldigi. This is often a mismatch between the serial
parameters Hamlib is using with FreeDV and your radio. For example you
may have changed the default serial rate on your radio. Carefully check
the serial parameters on your radio match those used by FreeDV in the
PTT Dialog.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="#common-problems">Common Problems</a> section of
this manual.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.2.2.1" id="hamlib"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.2.1</span> Hamlib</h4>
<p>Hamlib comes with a default serial rate for each radio. If your radio
has a different serial rate change the Serial Rate drop down box to
match your radio.</p>
<p>When <strong>Test</strong> is pressed, the “Serial Params” field is
populated and displayed. This will help track down any mismatches
between Hamlib and your radio.</p>
<p>If you are really stuck, download Hamlib and test your radio’s PTT
using the command line <code>rigctl</code> program.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.2.2.2" id="icom-radio-configuration"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.2.2</span> Icom Radio
Configuration</h4>
<p>If using an Icom radio, Hamlib will use the radio’s default CI-V
address when connecting. If this has been changed, you can specify the
correct address in the “Radio Address” field (valid values are 00
through FF in hexadecimal).</p>
<p>Note that “00” is the “wildcard” CI-V address. Your radio must have
the “CI-V Transceive” option enabled in order for it to respond to
commands to that address. Otherwise, FreeDV must be configured to use
the same CI-V address as configured in the radio. For best results,
ensure that there are no other Icom/CI-V capable devices in the chain if
“00”/“CI-V Transceive” is used.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.2.2.3" id="changing-com-port-on-windows"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.2.3</span> Changing COM Port On
Windows</h4>
<p>If you change the COM port of a USB-Serial device in Device Manager,
please unplug and plug back in the USB device. Windows/FreeDV won’t
recognize the device on the new COM Port until it has been
unplugged/plugged.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="test-wave-files"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Test Wave Files</h2>
<p>In the installation are audio files containing off-air FreeDV modem
signals. There is one file per FreeDV mode and are in the following
locations depending on platform:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 13%" />
<col style="width: 86%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Typical Location</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

</tr>
<tr class="odd">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To play these files, first select a FreeDV mode and press Start. Then
choose a file using “Tools - Start/Stop Play File From Radio”. You
should then hear decoded FreeDV speech.</p>
<p>These files will give you a feel for what FreeDV signals sound like,
and for the basic operation of the FreeDV software.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="sound-card-levels"><span
class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Sound Card Levels</h2>
<p>Sound card levels are generally adjusted in the computer’s Control
Panel or Settings, or in some cases via controls on your rig interface
hardware or menus on your radio. In-app adjustments can also be done by
using the ‘TX Level’ slider at the bottom of the main screen; anything
below 0 dB attenuates the transmit signal.</p>
<p>When FreeDV is running, you can observe the sound card signals in the
main window tabs (From Radio, From Mic, To Speaker).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On receive, FreeDV is not very sensitive to the <strong>From
Radio</strong> level, adjust so it is mid-range and not clipping. FreeDV
uses phase shift keying (PSK) so is not sensitive to amplitude.</p></li>
<li><p>The transmit level from your computer to your radio is important.
On transmit, adjust your level so that the ALC is <strong>just</strong>
being nudged. More <strong>is not better</strong> with the FreeDV
transmit signal. Overdriving your transmitter will lead to a distorted
transit signal, and a poor SNR at the receiver. This is a very common
problem.</p></li>
<li><p>FreeDV 700D and 700E can drive your transmitter at an average
power of 40% of its peak power rating. For example 40W RMS for a 100W
PEP radio. Make sure your transmitter can handle continuous power output
at these levels, and reduce the power if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust the microphone audio so the peaks are not clipping, and
the average is about half the maximum.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="2.5" id="audio-processing"><span
class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Audio Processing</h2>
<p>FreeDV likes a clean path through your radio. Turn all audio
processing <strong>OFF</strong> on transmit and receive:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On receive, DSP noise reduction should be off.</p></li>
<li><p>On transmit, speech compression should be off.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the receive audio path as “flat” as possible, no special
filters.</p></li>
<li><p>FreeDV will not work any better if you band pass filter the off
air received signals. It has its own, very tight filters in the
demodulator.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2.6" id="usb-or-lsb"><span
class="header-section-number">2.6</span> USB or LSB?</h2>
<p>On bands below 10 MHz, LSB is used for FreeDV. On 10MHz and above,
USB is used. After much debate, the FreeDV community has adopted the
same conventions as SSB, based on the reasoning that FreeDV is a voice
mode.</p>
<p>As an aid to the above, FreeDV will show the current mode on the
bottom of the window upon pressing the Start button if Hamlib is enabled
and your radio supports retrieving frequency and mode information over
CAT. If your radio is using an unexpected mode (e.g. LSB on 20 meters),
it will display that mode on the bottom of the window next to the Clear
button in red letters. When a session is not active, Hamlib isn’t
enabled, or if your radio doesn’t support retrieving frequency and mode
over CAT, it will remain grayed out with “unk” displaying instead of the
mode (for “unknown”).</p>
<h2 data-number="2.7" id="transceiver-filters"><span
class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Transceiver Filters</h2>
<p>For most FreeDV use, your radio’s receive and transmit filters should
be set to the widest possible (typically around 3 kHz). This allows easy
switching between analog mode as well as the various FreeDV modes. There
has not been any testing done to definitively confirm whether narrower
bandwidths help with reception of FreeDV. Additionally, FreeDV already
performs its own transmit filtering, so using additional narrow
filtering on the radio will likely have little benefit (again,
untested).</p>
<p>For reference, the channel widths of the currently supported modes
are below:</p>

<h1 data-number="3" id="voice-keyer"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Voice Keyer</h1>
<p>The Voice Keyer Button on the front page puts FreeDV and your radio
into transmit, reads a wave file of your voice to call CQ, and then
switches to receive to see if anyone is replying. If you press the space
bar or click the PTT button, the voice keyer stops. If a signal with a
valid sync is received for a few seconds the voice keyer also stops.</p>
<p>The Audio tab inside Tools-Options can be used to select the wave
file, set the RX delay, and number of times the TX/RX cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Additional options are also available if you right-click on the Voice
Keyer button:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Use another voice keyer file”: Allows you to trigger the voice
keyer using a different file from the one configured in
Tools-&gt;Options.</li>
<li>“Record new voice keyer file”: Triggers transmit and records your
microphone audio to a file that you select. Pushing the Voice Keyer
button will stop recording.</li>
<li>“Monitor transmitted audio”: Allows monitoring of audio while
transmitting the voice keyer file. If enabled, a checkmark will appear
next to this option.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="4" id="monitoring-tx-audio"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Monitoring TX Audio</h1>
<p>FreeDV has the ability to monitor transmit audio. This can be useful
for adjusting microphone filters when your radio is plugged into a dummy
load. To enable this, right-click on the PTT button and choose “Monitor
transmitted audio”. A checkmark will appear next to this menu option
when enabled.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="quick-record"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Quick Record</h1>
<p>To quickly record incoming signals from the radio, a ‘Record’ button
is provided in the main window. Clicking this button will create a file
beginning with the name “FreeDV_FromRadio” and containing the current
date and time. Clicking ‘Record’ again will stop recording.</p>
<p>The Audio tab inside Tools-Options allows control of where these
recordings are saved. By default, this is inside the current user’s
Documents folder.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="multiple-configurations"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Multiple Configurations</h1>
<p>By default, FreeDV uses the following locations to store
configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux: ~/.freedv</li>
<li>macOS: ~/Library/Preferences/FreeDV Preferences</li>
<li>Windows: Registry (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\freedv)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to store the configuration in another location (or
store multiple configurations), FreeDV accepts the -f (or –config)
command line arguments to provide an alternate location. An absolute
path is recommended here; however, if only a relative path is provided,
it will be relative to the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux: ~/</li>
<li>macOS: ~/Library/Preferences/</li>
<li>Windows: C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="6.1"
id="executing-freedv-with-a-different-configuration-windows"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Executing FreeDV With a
Different Configuration (Windows)</h2>
<p>On Windows, you can create shortcuts to FreeDV with different file
names for the “-f” command line option as described above. To create a
shortcut, right-click on the Desktop or in File Explorer and choose
New-&gt;Shortcut. Click on Browse and navigate to one of the following
paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\Program Files\FreeDV [version]\bin\freedv.exe</li>
<li>C:\Program Files (x86)\FreeDV [version]\bin\freedv.exe (if the 32
bit version is installed on a 64 bit machine)</li>
</ul>
<p>Click Next and give the shortcut a unique description (e.g. “FreeDV
IC-7300”). Then push Finish to create the shortcut.</p>
<p>Once the shortcut has been created, right-click it and choose
Properties. Find the Shortcut tab in the resulting dialog box and add
“-f” followed by the desired filename to the end of the text in the
Target field. Do not add any other quote marks.</p>
<p>For example, to use a file called IC7300.conf stored in the Hamradio
directory on the C drive the Target field should appear as follows:</p>
<p>“C:\Program Files\FreeDV [version]\bin\freedv.exe” -f
C:\Hamradio\IC7300.conf</p>
<h1 data-number="7" id="freedv-reporting"><span
class="header-section-number">7</span> FreeDV Reporting</h1>
<p>FreeDV has the ability to send FreeDV signal reports to various
online spotting services by enabling the option in Tools-Options (in the
Reporting tab) and specifying your callsign and Maidenhead grid square.
When enabled, this causes FreeDV to disable the free form <strong>Txt
Msg</strong> field and only transmit the <strong>Callsign</strong>
field. As this uses a different encoding format from the free-form text
field, both sides of the contact must have this enabled for the contact
to be reported.</p>
<p>FreeDV validates the received information before submitting a
position report. This is to ensure that FreeDV does not report invalid
callsigns to the service (e.g. ones that don’t exist or that correspond
to real non-FreeDV users). However, if the reporting function is
disabled, all received text will display in the main window even if it
has errors.</p>
<p>The following services are currently supported and can be
individually enabled or disabled along with the reporting feature as a
whole:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pskreporter.info/">PSK Reporter</a> (using the
“FREEDV” mode)</li>
<li><a href="https://qso.freedv.org/">FreeDV Reporter</a> – also
accessible via the Tools-&gt;FreeDV Reporter menu option.</li>
</ul>
<p>The frequency that FreeDV reports is set by changing the “Report
Frequency” drop down box in the main window. This is either in kilohertz
(kHz) or megahertz (MHz) (configurable by going to
Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Rig Control and checking or unchecking “Frequency
entry in kHz”) and will turn red if the entered value is invalid. If
Hamlib support is also enabled, this frequency will automatically remain
in sync with the current VFO on the radio (i.e. if the frequency is
changed in the application, the radio will also change its frequency).
Double-clicking on users in the Tools-&gt;FreeDV Reporter window will
also cause this frequency to change to match the other user.</p>
<p><em>Note: in some setups (such as when using ALE), it is not
preferred to have the reporting frequency automatically be in sync with
the radio. For example, in the case of ALE, the radio’s frequency
changes multiple times per second while waiting for a contact, which is
faster than FreeDV can pull the latest from the radio (every five
seconds). This can be disabled by enabling “Manual Frequency Reporting”
in Tools-&gt;Options.</em></p>
<p>FreeDV will also show the callsigns of previously received signals.
To view those, click on the arrow next to the last received callsign at
the bottom of the window. These are in descending order by time of
receipt (i.e. the most recently received callsign will appear at the top
of the list).</p>
<h1 data-number="8" id="multiple-mode-support"><span
class="header-section-number">8</span> Multiple Mode Support</h1>
<p>FreeDV can simultaneously decode the following modes when selected
prior to pushing “Start”:</p>
<ul>
<li>2020/2020B</li>
<li>700C/D/E</li>
<li>1600</li>
<li>800XA</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, FreeDV can allow the user to switch between the above
modes for transmit without having to push “Stop” first. These features
can be enabled by going to Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Modem and checking the
“Simultaneously Decode All HF Modes” option. Note that this may consume
significant additional CPU resources, which can cause decode
problems.</p>
<p>By default, FreeDV will use as many threads/cores in parallel as
required to decode all supported HF modes. On some slower systems, it
may be necessary to enable the “Use single thread for multiple RX
operation” option as well. This results in FreeDV decoding each mode in
series and additionally short circuits the list of modes to be checked
when in sync.</p>
<p>Additionally, the squelch setting with simultaneous decode enabled is
relative to the mode that supports the weakest signals (currently 700D).
The squelch for other modes will be set to a value higher than the
slider (which is calculated by adding the difference between the “Min
SNR” of 700D and the mode in question; see “FreeDV Modes” below). For
example, the squelch for 700E when the squelch slider is set to -2.0
becomes 1.0dB. This is designed to reduce undesired pops and clicks due
to false decodes.</p>

<p>The Min SNR is roughly the SNR where you cannot converse without
repeating yourself. The numbers above are on channels without fading
(AWGN channels like VHF radio). For fading channels the minimum SNR is a
few dB higher. The Fading column shows how robust the mode is to HF
Fading channels, higher is more robust.</p>
<p>The more advanced 700D and 2020 modes have a high latency due to the
use of large Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes. They buffer many
frames of speech, which combined with PC sound card buffering results in
end-to-end latencies of 1-2 seconds. They may take a few seconds to sync
at the start of an over, especially in fading channels.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.1" id="freedv-700d"><span
class="header-section-number">9.1</span> FreeDV 700D</h2>
<p>In mid 2018 FreeDV 700D was released, with a new OFDM modem, powerful
Forward Error Correction (FEC) and optional interleaving. It uses the
same 700 bit/s speech codec at 700C. It operates at SNRs as low as -2dB,
and has good HF channel performance. It is around 10dB better than
FreeDV 1600 on fading channels, and is competitive with SSB at low SNRs.
The FEC provides some protection from urban HF noise.</p>
<p>FreeDV 700D is sensitive to tuning. To obtain sync you must be within
+/- 60Hz of the transmit frequency. This is straightforward with modern
radios which are generally accurate to +/-1 Hz, but requires skill and
practice when used with older, VFO based radios.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.2" id="freedv-700e"><span
class="header-section-number">9.2</span> FreeDV 700E</h2>
<p>FreeDV 700E was developed in December 2020 using lessons learned from
on air operation of 700C and 700D. A variant of 700D, it uses a shorter
frame size (80ms) to reduce latency and sync time. It is optimized for
fast fading channels channels with up to 4Hz Doppler spread and 6ms
delay spread. FreeDV 7000E uses the same 700 bit/s codec as FreeDV 700C
and 700D. It requires about 3dB more power than 700D, but can operate
reliably on fast fading channels.</p>
<p>The 700E release also includes optional compression (clipping) of the
700D and 700E transmit waveforms to reduce the Peak to Average Power
Ratio to about 4dB. For example a 100W PEP transmitter can be driven to
about 40W RMS. This is an improvement of 6dB over previous releases of
FreeDV 700D. Before enabling the clipper make sure your transmitter is
capable of handling sustained high average power without damage.</p>
<p>Clipping can be enabled via Tools-Options.</p>
<p>On good channels with high SNR clipping may actually reduce the SNR
of the received signal. This is intentional - we are adding some
pre-distortion in order to increase the RMS power. Forward error
correction (FEC) will clean up any errors introduced by clipping, and on
poor channels the benefits of increased signal power outweigh the slight
reduction in SNR on good channels.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.3" id="freedv-2020"><span
class="header-section-number">9.3</span> FreeDV 2020</h2>
<p>FreeDV 2020 was developed in 2019. It uses an experimental codec
based on the LPCNet neural net (deep learning) synthesis engine
developed by Jean-Marc Valin. It offers 8 kHz audio bandwidth in an RF
bandwidth of just 1600 Hz. FreeDV 2020 employs the same OFDM modem and
FEC as 700D.</p>
<p>The purpose of FreeDV 2020 is to test neural net speech coding over
HF radio. It is highly experimental, and possibly the first use of
neural net vocoders in a real world, over the air system.</p>
<p>FreeDV 2020 is designed for slow fading HF channels with a SNR of
10dB or better. It is not designed for fast fading or very low SNRs like
700D. It is designed to be a high quality alternative to SSB in channels
where SSB is already an “arm-chair” copy. On an AWGN (non- fading
channel), it will deliver reasonable speech quality down to 2dB SNR.</p>
<p>FreeDV 2020 Tips:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It requires a modern (post 2010) Intel CPU with AVX support. If you
don’t have AVX the FreeDV 2020 mode button will be grayed out.</li>
<li>Some voices may sound very rough. In early testing about 90% of
speakers tested work well.</li>
<li>Like 700D, you must tune within -/+ 60Hz for FreeDV 2020 to
sync.</li>
<li>With significant fading, sync may take a few seconds.</li>
<li>There is a 2 second end-to-end latency. You are welcome to try
tuning this (Tools - Options - FIFO size, also see Sound Card Debug
section below).</li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="9.4" id="freedv-2020b"><span
class="header-section-number">9.4</span> FreeDV 2020B</h2>
<p>Experimental mode developed in February 2022. The goal of this mode
is to improve the performance of FreeDV 2020 over HF channels.</p>
<p>Here are the three main innovations, and the theoretical
improvements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compression (clipping) of the 2020x modem waveforms has been added,
which is worth about 4dB. This should also improve the original FreeDV
2020 mode. The Clipping checkbox is located on Tools-Options-Modem. As
per the other warnings in this manual please make sure you transmitter
can handle the higher RMS power.</li>
<li>2020B is like 700E to 700D - it works with fast fading but requires
a few more dB of SNR. This will make it usable in European Winter (or
over the South Pole Argentina to Australia) type channels - if you have
enough SNR. The challenge with this mode is squeezing all the
information we need (enough pilots symbols for fast fading, LPCNet, FEC
bits) into a 2100 Hz channel - we are pushing up again the edges of many
SSB filters. It also uses unequal FEC, just the most important 11 bits
are protected.</li>
</ol>
<p>This modes is under development and may change at any time. If you
experience comparability issues with another operator - check your Git
Hash values on the Help-about menu to ensure you are running the same
versions of LPCNet and codec2.</p>
<p>It is recommended that multi-RX be disabled when using 2020B. This
mode is not supported by multi-RX, you will need to manually coordinate
the mode with other stations.</p>

class="header-section-number">11</span> Helping Improve FreeDV</h1>
<p>If you have an interesting test case, for example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>FreeDV working poorly with a particular person or microphone.</li>
<li>Poor over the air performance on a fast fading channel.</li>
<li>Problems with sync on strong signals.</li>
<li>A comparison with SSB.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please send the developers an off air recording of the signal. FreeDV
can record files from your radio using Tools-Record File from Radio. A
recording of 30 to 60 seconds is most useful.</p>
<p>With a recording we can reproduce your exact problem. If we can
reproduce it we can fix it. Recordings are much more useful than
anecdotes or subjective reports like “FreeDV doesn’t work”, “SSB is
better”, or “On 23 December it didn’t work well on grid location XYZ”.
With subjective reports problems are impossible to reproduce, cannot be
fixed, and you are unlikely to get the attention of the developers.</p>
<h1 data-number="12" id="multiple-panes-in-gui-window"><span
class="header-section-number">12</span> Multiple Panes in GUI
window</h1>
<p>It is possible to have multiple panes opened within the GUI window
for example, to observe both the Waterfall and Spectrum Tabs. New panes
may be added above, below, left or right of existing panes.</p>
<p>A new visible pane is created by hovering the cursor over the
required Tab, click and hold the left mouse button and drag the Tab to
the required position and releasing the mouse button. If currently two
panes are stacked vertically a third pane may be added either beside
either pane or to the left/right of both panes. If the Tab is required
adjacent to both panes then it must be dragged to the left/right of the
junction of the existing Tabs.</p>
<p>As the Tab is dragged into position a faint blue/gray image will show
the position to be occupied by the pane. Panes may be relocated back to
the menu bar by a similar process.</p>
<p>Tabs can be resized as required by hovering the cursor over the
border and clicking and holding the left mouse button and dragging to
required size.</p>
<p>By default, the tab layout is not saved. However, by enabling
experimental features (see “Advanced/Developer Features”), experimental
support for saving and restoring the tab layout will be enabled. This
has not been well tested and may have hidden bugs or other issues.</p>

<p>The sample clock offset is the estimated difference between the
modulator (TX) and demodulator (RX) sample clocks. For example if the
transmit station sound card is sampling at 44000 Hz and the receive
station sound card 44001 Hz, the sample clock offset would be
((44000-44001)/44000)*1E6 = 22.7 ppm.</p>

<p>Debug FIFO and PortAudio counters: used for debugging audio problems
on 700D. During beta testing there were problems with break up in the
700D TX and RX audio on Windows.</p>
<p>The PortAudio counters (PortAudio1 and PortAudio2) should not
increment when running in TX or RX, as this indicates samples are being
lost by the sound driver which will lead to sync problems.</p>
<p>The Fifo counter outempty1 counter should not increment during TX, as
this indicates FreeDV is not supplying samples fast enough to the
PortAudio drivers. The results will be resyncs at the receiver.</p>
<p>Check these counters by pressing Start, then Reset them and observe
the counters for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>If the PortAudio counters are incrementing on receive try:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Adjusting framesPerBuffer; try 0, 128, 256, 512, 1024.</p></li>
<li><p>Shut down other applications that might be using audio, such as
Skype or your web browser.</p></li>
<li><p>A different sound card rate such as 44.1kHz instead of
48kHz.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the outempty1 counter is incrementing on transmit try increasing
the FifoSize.</p>
<p>The txThreadPriority checkbox reduces the priority of the main txRX
thread in FreeDV which may help the sound driver thread process
samples.</p>
<p>The txRXDumpTiming check box dumps timing information to a console
that is used for debugging the RX break up problem on 700D. Each number
is how many ms the txRXThread took to run.</p>
<p>The txRXDumpTiming check box dumps the number of samples free in the
TX FIFO sending samples to the TX. If this hits zero, your TX audio will
break up and the RX will lose sync. TX audio break up will also occur if
you see “outfifo1” being incremented on the “Fifo” line during TX. Try
increasing the FifoSize.</p>
<h2 data-number="13.4" id="test-frame-histogram"><span
class="header-section-number">13.4</span> Test Frame Histogram</h2>
<p>This feature was developed for testing FreeDV 700C. Select the Test
Frame Histogram tab on Front Page</p>
<p>Displays BER of each carrier when in “test frame” mode. As each QPSK
carrier has 2 bits there are 2*Nc histogram points.</p>
<p>Ideally all carriers will have about the same BER (+/- 20% after 5000
total bit errors), however problems can occur with filtering in the TX
path. If one carrier has less power, then it will have a higher BER. The
errors in this carrier will tend to dominate overall BER. For example if
one carrier is attenuated due to SSB filter ripple in the TX path then
the BER on that carrier will be higher. This is bad news for DV.</p>
<p>Suggested usage:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Transmit FreeDV in test frame mode. Use a 2nd RX (or get a
friend) to monitor your RX signal with FreeDV in test frame
mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust your RX SNR to get a BER of a few % (e.g. reduce TX power,
use a short antenna for the RX, point your beam away, adjust RX RF
gain).</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor the error histogram for a few minutes, until you have say
5000 total bit errors. You have a problem if the BER of any carrier is
more than 20% different from the rest.</p></li>
<li><p>A typical issue will be one carrier at 1.0 and the others at 0.5,
indicating the poorer carrier BER is twice the larger.</p></li>

class="header-section-number">15.1</span> FreeDV Sets Radio To Wrong
Mode</h2>
<p>By default, FreeDV attempts to set the radio’s mode to DIGU/USB-D (or
LSB equivalent for 40 meters and below). Some radios do not support data
modes and only have USB and LSB. For these, you can go to
Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Rig Control and check the “Use USB/LSB instead of
DIGU/DIGL” option. This will cause FreeDV to use the standard USB and
LSB modes for rig control instead.</p>
<p>Note that for best results, your radio should have all processing
disabled if you’re using the standard USB/LSB modes. This disabling of
processing typically takes place when using data mode.</p>
<h2 data-number="15.2" id="overdriving-transmit-level"><span
class="header-section-number">15.2</span> Overdriving Transmit
Level</h2>
<p>This is a very common problem for first time FreeDV users. Adjust
your transmit levels so the ALC is just being nudged. More power is not
better with FreeDV. An overdriven signal will have poor SNR at the
receiver. For FreeDV 700D/700E operation with the clipper, make sure
your transmitter can sustain high average power levels without damage
(e.g. 40W RMS on a 100W PEP radio).</p>

configured in FreeDV does not match the address configured in the radio.
Ensure that the CI-V address in both FreeDV and on the radio are the
same. If “00” is used on the FreeDV side, ensure that the “CI-V
Transceive” option is enabled on the radio or else the radio will not
respond to requests directed to that address.</p>
