  .SYNOPSIS
  Blocks until the named Windows audio endpoints are enumerable, or fails with
  diagnostics after a timeout.

  .DESCRIPTION
  FreeDV enumerates audio devices through the Core Audio MMDevice API and aborts
  with a fatal "device cannot be found" message box if a configured device is
  missing when a test starts. On CI the virtual cables (VB-Cable / VAC) sometimes
  take a while to expose their render / capture endpoints after the audio service
  is (re)started, or briefly drop out of enumeration after another process
  releases them -- which makes the PGO profile collection job fail intermittently.

  This script polls "Get-AudioDevice -List" (from AudioDeviceCmdlets, the same
  active-endpoint enumeration surface FreeDV uses) until every required endpoint
  is present. It restarts the Windows audio stack once up front and once more
  partway through as a nudge. On timeout it prints a full device dump and throws.

  .PARAMETER Playback
  Names of required playback (render) endpoints.

  .PARAMETER Recording
  Names of required recording (capture) endpoints.

  .PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
  Total time to wait for all endpoints. Default 180.

  .PARAMETER NoRestart
  Do not restart the audio services (just poll).

  .EXAMPLE
  PS> ./ci/Wait-AudioDevices.ps1 `
        -Playback  "Speakers (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)", "Line 1 (Virtual Audio Cable)" `
        -Recording "CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)", "Line 1 (Virtual Audio Cable)"
