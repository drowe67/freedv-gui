"""Virtual audio devices for FreeDV to use during tests.

On Linux, they're created for each test with PulseAudio/PipeWire, as null
sinks: what's played into one can be heard from its monitor.

On macOS, devices can't be created like that, so tests are given loopback
devices that are already there (BlackHole and VB-Cable: what's played into
one comes back from its input) in place of the ones they ask for, by
device(). Most tests need four, separate from each other: a driver's extra
devices ("BlackHole 2ch 2", "VB-Cable A") carry what's played into its first,
so they're left out. (build_macos_sound_drivers.sh builds four BlackHole
drivers, as CI uses.) Which there are to use is found out, or can be given as
a comma-separated list in $FREEDVTEST_AUDIO_DEVICES. Tests that need something
that can't be done there (more devices than there are, or anything to do with
the sound server itself) raise Unavailable, for which a test script exits
with 77 (skipped). sox plays and records.

Windows is like macOS, with Virtual Audio Cable's lines and VB-Cable as the
loopback devices (named, as FreeDV names them, after where they're played
into, e.g. "Line 1 (Virtual Audio Cable)" or "Speakers (VB-Audio Virtual
Cable)", and recorded from under the same name or that of the input with the
same driver's name in brackets), and the sounddevice module playing and
recording (see wasapi.py). Virtual Audio Cable comes first: VB-Cable now and
then leaves a few milliseconds out of what's played through it.
With fewer than four, they're shared: with two, as Windows CI has, one for
the radio's input and output and the other for the microphone and speaker,
as CI's other tests have them. (With three, the radio's share one.)
$FREEDVTEST_AUDIO_DEVICES can name the same device more than once to share
it. Checks that can't be made on a shared device (that nothing's played into
one while something else is) are left out where shared() says so.
